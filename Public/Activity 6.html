<p>
    I am Louise Candice Mariano Ranin, 18 years old, my hometown is in Bulawan, Payao, Zamboanga Sibugay
    and I am born on <a href="./Activity 3.html"> October 07, 2007</a>.
    My favorite color is naivy blue and dark red, I love the sound of the rain, I love to spend 
    my time with my loved ones, I love to cook, I love to sing, I am kind, and that's only the few
    information about me.
    I am just a simple girl but with a big great desire, where I want my all of my dreams to come true, 
    to do the things that i want, to love, and more.
    I will also do anything to just to protect my peace.
<br/>
</p>

<p>
    One more thing about me is that I love my family more than anything, specially my parents,
    because they are the kind of parents where they always show their support, guide me, and love me
    even if i make mistakes sometimes, I am beyond greatful to have them as my parents and would do 
    anything I can to pay them back even if they don't want me to do that because they only want me 
    to do something to make my future better. I already notice my parent's full support and love for me
    even when i was only a kid so i can say that they are consistent until now its just now that I am 
    already a grown up woman, they trust me more of making my life better. Worrying about my future
    isn't easy, specially whenever I doubt my self and I get very pressured, but life still goes.
    <br/>
</p>
Now, I will continue to trust myself and I hope to achieve the dreams i've been dreaming about and 
build a meaningful career that will make myself and my family proud.
I will slowly continue to improve my self and to become the best version of myself with 
determination and faith, and I will do anything I can do to accomplish my goals and create a bright
future ahead
